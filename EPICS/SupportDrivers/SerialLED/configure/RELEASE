## configure/RELEASE: Location of external products

# Run "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the application top
# directory whenever this file is changed or any external module
# pointed to by this RELEASE file is rebuilt.

# If you don't want to install files into $(TOP) then define
# INSTALL_LOCATION_APP here:
#INSTALL_LOCATION_APP=<fullpathname>

# Define path to sequencer if needed
#SNCSEQ=_SNCSEQ_

# Asyn
ASYN=/home/greghaynes/asyn-4.12

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can preempt definitions
EPICS_BASE=/home/greghaynes/base-3-14-11
